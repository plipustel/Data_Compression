# Data_Compression
@Descriptions:
As a final project to complete my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science @2011 in University of Sumatera Utara, Indonesia. This project is a software that implements Lossless Data Compression Algorithms (Lempel Ziv Welch, Arithmetic Coding, Burrows Wheeler Transform, and Run-Length Encoding Algorithm)

@Implemented By : Plipus Telaumbanua (plipus.tel@gmail.com)
@Year : 2010 - 2021 @Computer Science Department University of Sumatera Utara
@Technologies: Borland Delphi 7.0 - Pascal
@Lossless Data Compression Algorithms:
- Lempel Ziv Welch
- Arithmetic Coding
- Burrows Wheeler Transforms
- Run-Length Encoding

As this project was satisfied by department, then I specially dedicated this project to my beloved Mother who always besides & motivated me while writing the codes (1957 - RIP 2015)
